Sub-Objective 2: Design and Development of a Machine Learning Pipeline

2.1 Model Preparation:
- Selected Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
- Reason: Handles large datasets efficiently and works well with both categorical and numerical data.

2.2 Model Training:
- 70% training and 30% testing
- Stratified sampling to handle class imbalance
- Categorical variables encoded using one-hot encoding
- Missing values handled with mean (numerical) and mode (categorical)

2.3 Model Evaluation:
- Accuracy: 0.7900

2.4 MLOps: Metrics Logged
- Accuracy: 0.7900
- Precision: 0.8182
- Recall: 0.9532
- F1 Score: 0.8805
